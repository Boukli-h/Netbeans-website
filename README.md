# Netbeans-website
 A business-to-customer (B2C) e-commerce for a small retail store.
 
 This was the first website I have created after finishing JAVA classes with Walden University. I choose Netbeans IDE, because I was familiar with it at the University. 
 
 I developped this website by following Apache NetBeans web sites tutoriels: 
 https://netbeans.apache.org/kb/docs/javaee/ecommerce/intro.html
 
 And CS.Math.Educator on YouTube:
